It's a bunch of old scratch projects from 2010 to 2011. See the sources files [here](https://github.com/Alex-Costea/Old-Scratch-Projects).

To run, zip the folders to a new file, and change the extension to `.sb3`. Then you can open them using the [Scratch app](https://scratch.mit.edu/download).

Or open them as HTML5 files (with the original description, if relevant, below):

## [Reversiball](reversiball.html)

Reversiball was a normal ball in the land of balls, until it discovered that it could reverse the force of gravity, thus falling upwards. For that reason it was banned from the Cyan Zone where was its family. Its family was very upset because of that.

After five years, the President had changed and with him also the ban on Reversiball. It seemed easy to enter the Cyan Zone, but across the zones there was a war so there were a lot of soldiers and the ground was destroyed.
