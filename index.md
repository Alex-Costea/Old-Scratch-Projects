# Old Scratch Projects

It's a bunch of old scratch projects. See the sources files [here](https://github.com/Alex-Costea/Old-Scratch-Projects).

To run, zip the folders to a new file, and change the extension to `.sb3`. Then you can open them using the [Scratch app](https://scratch.mit.edu/download).

Or open them as HTML5 files:
